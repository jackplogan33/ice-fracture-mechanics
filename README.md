# Derived Yeild Stresses of Antarctic Glaciers in Cloud-Native Framework


The accessing cloud hosted data portion of this workflow is modelled after Emma Marshall's github found [here](https://e-marshall.github.io/itslive/intro.html#). For introductory data acquisition and plotting of velocities, I highly recommend follwing her workflow. It will give a much more in depth look at data cubes and chunking with dask that is looked over here.

I have written functions that will open ITS_LIVE datacubes from a given shapefile, but to fully understand the workings of these functions I recommend following her tutorial.
